Very Simple Development Log application powered by CodeIgniter

I was looking for an application that can do just one simple task, 'Logging'. Other programs that already exist seem too complicated, regarding what I wanted to achieve. So, I decided to write my own. This application's only one purpose is to keep track of all my tasks, ideas, and thoughts without having to click multiple links and buttons. It will simply write to specified database (MySQL 5.5), and display all logs that are in the database in a table. More functions will be added. Currently, it only supports write & read functionalities.

More information on installation and details will be posted later after full development
